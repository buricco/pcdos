Note on Localization
====================

  Most of the utilities use the main message index.  This is set in 
  src/setenv.bat and src/messages/makefile.  There are a few exceptions:
  
    * attrib: messages.h (Castilian Spanish in msg_eses.h)
    * choice: would require a bit of manual work
    * emm386: memm/emmmes.asm and memm/memm_msg.inc
    * ramdrive: messages.asm (Castilian Spanish in msg_eses.asm)
    * smartdrv: at the end of smartdrv.asm (Castilian Spanish in smrtdves.asm)

  The Spanish localization is almost complete except for choice (I do have the
  data to do such a localization), emm386 (too different from any Spanish
  builds I have) and fdisk (it's complicated).
